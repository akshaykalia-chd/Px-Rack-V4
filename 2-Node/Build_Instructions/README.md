## PX-Rack 2-Node Enclosure Assembly Overview
The directory contains PDF files showing the various steps involved in assembling the PX-Rack 2-node enclosure.

Each step includes a parts list along with the required mounting screws and nuts. Before starting to follow the drawings in this section, make sure you have purchased all the required components and 3D-printed all the necessary parts.

**The build steps do not cover electronics integration.** This is intentional. Before ordering the electronics and attempting integration, I recommend that you fully assemble the PX-Rack enclosure.

However, Electronics integration will take place after **Step-2**, and by the end of **Step-3** all electronics should be in place, except for the ventilation fans. The fans will be installed after **Step-4** and before **Step-5**.

*Electronics integration is slightly nuanced and cannot be explained adequately using drawings. I will include videos for this process in the near future.*
