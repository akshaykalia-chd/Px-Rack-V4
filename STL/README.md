This folder contains all STL files needed to 3D print the various parts of the PX-Rack.

## File Naming Convention

The file names is the folder follow te following pattern 

1. **3d‑YYYY‑MM‑XXX‑XXXXX‑nnnA:** All part numbers with this format must be 3D printed.
   1. *YYYY:* The year in which the part design was last modified. 
   2. *MM:* The month in which the part design was last modified. 
   3. *XXX‑XXXX:* Specifies the material information the part should be printed in. 
   4. *nnnA:* A number followed by a letter. All parts that are joined together to form one unit will share the same numerical portion, followed by an incremental alphabet character.
2. **AAAAAAA‑nnnmm:** All parts with this format must be purchased and cut to length
   1. AAAAAAA: Defines the type of part. 
   2. nnnmm: Length of the part in millimeters. 
3. **AAAAAA‑AAAAA:** All parts with this format must be purchased.

## What is STL? ##
In 3D printing, STL files are the most common file format used to describe 3D models. STL stands for STereoLithography (or sometimes Standard Triangle Language) and encodes the surface geometry of an object using triangular facets that slicing software can interpret. A slicing software is the tool that converts a 3D model (like an STL file) into layer-by-layer instructions (G-code) that a printer can understand and execute. 

## What is ABS? ##
ABS stands for Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene. It is a thermoplastic polymer widely used in 3D printing, especially with FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) printers. Known for being strong, durable, and impact-resistant, ABS is the same material used in LEGO bricks, car dashboards, and protective housings.

The glass transition temperature of ABS is between 100 and 120 °C. Hence, it is best suited for components operating close to heat-generating parts in the PX-Rack.

## What is PETG? ## 

PETG stands for Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol-modified. It is a thermoplastic derived from PET (the same plastic used in water bottles), with glycol added to improve durability and reduce brittleness. PETG combines the ease of printing of PLA with the strength and heat resistance of ABS, making it a versatile middle-ground filament.

The glass transition temperature of PETG is between 80 and 100 °C. While it can be used for external parts, it is not suitable for components operating in the vicinity of heat-generating elements in the PX-Rack.



## What is PLA? ##
PLA stands for Polylactic Acid. It is a biodegradable thermoplastic made from renewable resources such as corn starch or sugarcane. PLA is the most widely used filament in desktop 3D printing because it is easy to print, affordable, and environmentally friendly compared to petroleum-based plastics like ABS.

However, the glass transition temperature of PLA lies between 60 and 80 °C. As a result, a large number of PX-Rack components cannot be manufactured using PLA.

PLA should only be used for printing PX-Rack parts as a last resort when printing in PETG is not possible.
